# GameJam1
 
 So far we have a pong tutorial completed and messed with the code
 for the game we are creating. In the future the pong tutorial will
 be removed from this code base. Right now, it's a reference point.

 The general strategy is to define ron files for the values of the
 game (i.e. food, skills, and map layout). This then will be loaded
 in at the start. TBC...
